## TutLogger by (Matthew) Issa Aboudi (CLI VERSION - DEPRICATED)
As an LPC tutor I wanted a more convenient way to keep track of the tutees I have, and the sessions I have done on a particular day. Application is completely terminal based as of 1/5/2022 but I have plans to make this a cross platform GUI (graphical user interface) application.

**Libraries & Toolkits used:**

The project includes a makefile which you can use to generate a linux executable - Mac and Windows not implemented as of 1/5/2022
